title: Chapter 2
scene: The Inciting Incident
---

Now, the inciting incident can happen in the first chapter. Keep in mind that by doing so, you are promising your readers a fast-paced book, and therefore you'll have to maintain this throughout.

At the same time, you can also have a chapter between the first and the inciting incident if you want to develop a stronger emotional tie to your character first.

However, the inciting incident typically happens later in the book, in chapter two or three. Avoid putting this incident several chapters into your book or readers will get board, and will have the mindset of, "just get to the good stuff already".
